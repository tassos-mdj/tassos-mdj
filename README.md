## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Tassos

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently employed on a different field (stationary store!)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m in the process of *properly* learning Frontend development
        through 'The Odin Project', coming from a background
        with a degree in CS and 7 years in IT.

In the past I have set up several websites, for business purpose or just for fun
including a fully operational WooCommerce online store, though 90% of everything
was through no-code tools, such as themplates, plugins and WYSIWYG editors.

I'm aiming for full stack development knowledge and some fun projects!
